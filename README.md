 (completed above) Define a function, as a function declaration, maxOfTwoNumbersthat takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a ternary expression - the Math.max method is not allowed.
Define a function, as a function expression, maxOfThreethat takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed.
Define a function, as a function declaration, isCharAVowelthat takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
Define a function, as a function expression, sumArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, sumArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 11.
Define a function, as a function declaration, multiplyArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 40.
